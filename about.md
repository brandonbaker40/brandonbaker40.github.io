<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a web developer who started coding a few years after college, realizing that the only way I was going to bring my ideas to life was to actually learn how to do the work myself.</p>

<p>After some confusing attempts at learning through MOOC's, I quit my awesome growth hacker job at a bootstrapped media startup in the Southwest and enrolled in Bloc.io's Software Developement Track, where I'd benefit enormously from their mentorship model and curriculum designed for people like me.</p>

<p>Bloc's self-paced model afforded me the time to work for my father's 18-year-old legacy healthcare company, which was struggling to grow because of internal inefficiencies and high turnover. I applied many of the same growth techniques I learned from my last job to transform the business into a sustainable, revenue-generating, well-oiled machine. 

<p>I'm now in the final module of the curriculum with Bloc--the Open Source Apprenticeship, and looking for my first full-time job as a web developer. I am really hungry to learn from experienced developers in a team environment. I've learned that part of becoming a better web developer means surrounding yourself with people that are more knowledgeable, more experienced, and all around better than you.</p>


<p>I've learned HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and key programming concepts that have prepared me for a job as a web developer. My current focus is on learning JavaScript, Angular 6, and Material Design.</p>

<p>Outside of web development, I really enjoy Crossfit, baseball, relaxing on the lake, and spending time with friends, family and beautiful wife.</p>
