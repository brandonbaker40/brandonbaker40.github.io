# About Me

### My Mission

> To solve complex problems by challenging the status quo and building software that is performant, easy to use, and valuable.  

<br>

Hello, 

I'm a software developer. I learned to code because I wanted to build what only my imagination could. Now I build software and use these tools to get the job done: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

When I'm not coding, I'm playing slow-pitch softball, working out, and spending time with friends and family.
