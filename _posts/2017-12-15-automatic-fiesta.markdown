Automatic Fiesta - [Deployed on Heroku](https://vast-cliffs-69339.herokuapp.com/). 

Automatic Fiesta is a SasS application for home health agencies and their staffing agency peers to reduce the cost of care coordination. 

What started as a personal project for learning Rails has now evolved into an application preparing for a pilot with a home health staffing agency in Maryland, who is now funding further development on this project.

Developing this application has challenged me to explore technologies beyond what I've learned through the curriculum with Bloc.io. I've gained a deeper understanding of Rails, learned how to make API calls to external services like Mapbox and Twilio, how to make rake tasks, and how to build an application for a real business case.
